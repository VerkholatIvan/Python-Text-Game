# Python-Text-Game is a multifunctional program, which allows playing a small text game. This code was fully created by Ivan Verkholat for University's Final Assessment.
To win in this game the user must get 10 and more points. If the counter of your score will drop less than 0 the player will lose. The result of the game will be shown in the message box, whenever points conditions are met.

Necessary Libraries:
  - tkinter (interaction window to enter different rooms, shop, and inventory)
  - from tkinter import messagebox (used to tell the user the result for the game )
  - random
  - numpy
  - time (was added for animation, while waiting for battle results)
  
  
How to play:
The game itself is going inside the terminal, but to enter different rooms it is necessary to press buttons in the popup window.
Not to break the game the user must choose the exit option in the current room before entering another. If in the end you have pressed a different room and got the error, just scroll a bit up to see a number to enter to exit the current room, and you may continue using the program. The "Inventory" button will not affect an error but may look confusing when it is called inside the room.
