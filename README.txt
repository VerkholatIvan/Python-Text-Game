# Python-Text-Game is a multifunctional program, which allows to play a small text game. This code was fully created by Ivan Verkholat for University Final Assessment.

Necessary Libraries:
  - tkinter (interaction window to enter different rooms, shop and inventory)
  - random
  - numpy
  - time (was added for animation, while waiting foe battle results)
  
  
How to play:
Game itself is going inside the terminal, but to enter different rooms it is necessary to press buttons in the window.
Not to break the game the user must choose exit option in the current room before entering another. The "Inventory" button will not affect an error, but may look confusing when it is called inside the room.
